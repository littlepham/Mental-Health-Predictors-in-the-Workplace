Since some of the models in R did not recognize categorical variables, and thus would not automatically convert them into dummy variables, we had to mutate our data manually in order to transform them. In addition, since our question only took into account those who have/had/experience/experienced mental health illness, we excluded entries from individuals who did not experience mental health illness. After we constructed our model and tried to make logical sense of our outputs, we realized that it did not really make sense, since work interference was on a scale of 0-4, ranging from "Never" and "Often." To allow a simpler question, instead of making numerous dummy variables, we instead chose to mutate the work interference data to a simple "Yes" or "No" or 1 or 2, to allow for a bernoulli distribution. These changes/simplification of the data let us still answer the same question of which were the strongest predictors of work interference in the workplace for those who suffer from mental health afflictions, but in a more simplistic manner.
